## Video Demo: https://youtu.be/aURv6aC4MmE

## Project Description:
> This project encrypts and decrypts text using Caesar and Substitution Encryption.
>
> 1. Caesar Encryption: Move the letters back 3 letters (a -> x, b -> y, c -> z).
> 2. Substitution Encryption: Move the letters into a cipher and then substitute each letter into the old text.
>
> This project also makes use of password generators to select (TRUE/FALSE) and password length (8 - 100 characters).
>
> This project saves the passwords locally on the person's phone.
